# ASTR 480 Assignments Template

NOTE TO THE GRADER: As in the canvas announcement, I am to indicate the files or ARCSAT directories I used for the reduction. My group observed on the nights of May 26 (first group) and May 28 (second group), so within the corresponding  ARCSAT directories are the files used for this assignment. 
My functions use files downloaded from ARCSAT and stored in two locations: One (May 26 early night data) in my jupytrhub work folder identical to how the ccd-reductions-data file was stored for the ccd-reductions assignment, and the other (May 28 late night data) on my personal computer. I uploaded that to jupytr as a zip file in order to save space (it was 4 GB big and I had 1 GB left). This also consequentially involved rewriting my functions to handle zip files without downloading everything all at once.
In the Notebooks folder I have submitted my draft notebook in which all my functions were created and tested. If canvas allows me, I intend to submit this file along with my paper as a precaution. 
Thank you!
